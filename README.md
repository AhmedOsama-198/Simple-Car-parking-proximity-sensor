# Simple-Car-parking-proximity-sensor
Objective:
The aim of this project is to design a simple car parking sensor system that helps drivers detect obstacles and avoid collisions while parking. The system measures the distance between the car and an obstacle using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the distance on an LCD screen. LEDs and a buzzer provide visual and auditory warnings based on the proximity of the object.
Overview:
This project uses an ATmega32 microcontroller to process distance data from an ultrasonic sensor and display the results on an LCD. The system includes three LEDs (Red, Green, and Blue) and a buzzer for indicating the proximity of an obstacle. The LEDs light up progressively and the buzzer activates as the obstacle gets closer, helping drivers park safely.
